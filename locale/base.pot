"The FollowChannel Module was an alternative for Discords AnnouncementChannel "
"for those developers, who couldn't afford a Game License. When Discord "
"enabled the [Community-Servers](https://support.discord.com/hc/de/"
"articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server) for every server, they "
"also enabled the AnnouncementChannel for every Server.\n"
"Therefore, the FollowChannel Module from Supporter is no longer useful and "
"will be removed from the Bot. There is a transition period, so you can set "
"up a AnnouncementChannel and inform everyone about the changes.\n"
"The FollowChannel Module, which include the commands `follow` and `publish` "
"will be deactivated at **November 7, 2020**. This is the same date, when "
"Discord will drop the support for the old domain *discordapp.com*."
